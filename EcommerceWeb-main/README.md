CREATING A RESPONSIVE WEBSITE
Objective:
In this Project, you will have the exciting opportunity to transform a wireframe into a fully responsive website, showcasing your creativity, web design skills, and attention to detail. This exercise will help you understand the principles of responsive web design, including designing for different breakpoints (lg, md, and sm), consistent font usage, and creating engaging content.

Instructions:

    Wireframe Reference:
You will receive a wireframe for a website that covers the lg (large) breakpoint. This wireframe serves as your reference for the desktop version of the website. (see the attached PNG file)

       Design for Multiple Breakpoints
Your task is to design the website for three different breakpoints:
* lg (large): Refer to the wireframe for the desktop design.
* md (medium): Design for tablet-sized screens.
* sm (small): Design for mobile phones.

    Content and Text:
* Replace all placeholder text in the wireframe with unique and relevant content. Be creative with your text and ensure it aligns with the theme or purpose of the website.
* Choose a unique website name that reflects the website's content or purpose.

    Font Consistency: 
Maintain consistent font usage throughout the website. Choose an appropriate font that is legible and suits the website's style.

    Images and Logo:
Incorporate your own images and logo into the design. You may use royalty-free images or create your visuals to make the website more personalized and unique.

    Submission Guidelines:
* Once you have completed your website design, create a GitHub repository to host your project.
* Upload all the necessary files and assets related to your website to the GitHub repository.
* Share the GitHub repository link as your submission.

    Important Notes:
* Responsiveness: Test your design to ensure it functions and looks appealing on different devices and screen sizes.
* Creativity: Be imaginative in your content and design choices to create an engaging and visually appealing website.
* Feedback: If you encounter any challenges or have questions, feel free to seek assistance from the teachers or peers.

Good luck, and enjoy the creative process
